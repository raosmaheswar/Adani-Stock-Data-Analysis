# Adani Stock Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)
Analysing Adani stock data using Excel and PowerBI

I'm a Power BI dashboard showcasing a comprehensive analysis of Adani Group stocks, designed to provide valuable insights for investors and market watchers. My purpose is to present complex financial data in a clear, interactive, and easily digestible format.

Key Features & Data Handling:

Data Sources: I pull data from reliable financial sources (NSE) to ensure accuracy and up-to-dateness.
Excel Data Preparation: Before the data reaches Power BI, it undergoes a crucial cleaning and transformation process in Excel. This includes:
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values (using techniques like imputation or removal), correcting inconsistencies, and removing duplicates to ensure data integrity.
Data Transformation: Restructuring the data for optimal analysis in Power BI, including:
Data Type Conversion: Ensuring correct data types (e.g., dates, numbers, text) for calculations and visualizations.
Creating Calculated Columns: Generating new metrics like dates/day/monthly/quarter close, open, and other relevant financial indicators.
Pivoting and Unpivoting: Restructuring data for better reporting and analysis.
Power BI Visualizations: I leverage Power BI's powerful visualization capabilities to present the data in various formats, including:
Interactive Charts: Line charts, and bar charts for volume analysis.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Displaying essential metrics like the average of 52W H, an average of 52W L, open total, close total, and Volume totals. 
Drill-down Functionality: Allowing users to explore data at different levels of granularity, from overall group performance to individual stock analysis.
Filtering and Slicing: Enabling users to focus on specific periods, Adani Group companies, or other relevant criteria.
