# Adani Stock Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)
Analysing Adani stock data using Excel and PowerBI

I'm a Power BI dashboard showcasing a comprehensive analysis of Adani Group stocks, designed to provide valuable insights for investors and market watchers. My purpose is to present complex financial data in a clear, interactive, and easily digestible format.

Key Features & Data Handling:

- Data Sources: I pull data from reliable financial sources (NSE) https://www.nseindia.com/  to ensure accuracy and up-to-dateness.
- Excel Data Preparation: Before the data reaches Power BI, it undergoes a crucial cleaning and transformation process in Excel. This includes:
- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values (using techniques like imputation or removal), correcting inconsistencies, and removing duplicates to ensure data integrity.
- Data Transformation: Restructuring the data for optimal analysis in Power BI, including:
- Data Type Conversion: Ensuring correct data types (e.g., dates, numbers, text) for calculations and visualizations.
- Creating Calculated Columns: Generating new metrics like date/days//Quarter/month, Volume.
- Pivoting and Unpivoting: Restructuring data for better reporting and analysis.
- Power BI Visualizations: I leverage Power BI's powerful visualization capabilities to present the data in various formats, including:
- Interactive Charts: Line charts for stock price trends, bar charts for volume analysis, and scatter plots for correlation studies.
- Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Displaying essential metrics like averages of 52W H, averages of 52W L, Open totals, Close totals, and Volume totals.
- Drill-down Functionality: Allowing users to explore data at different levels of granularity, from overall group performance to individual stock analysis.
- Filtering and Slicing: Enabling users to focus on specific periods, Adani Group companies, or other relevant criteria.
